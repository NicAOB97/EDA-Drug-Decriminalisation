"(1) 10a3: The FNAILS contains information about arrests (broken down into simple use, use/dealing, local trafficking, and international trafficking) and seizures.  The substance stated is the """"predominant drug"""", i.e. the main drug taken by the user or held in the largest quantities by the trafficker.  If this rule cannot be applied, the """"hardest"""" drug is used. This data source is managed by the Central Office for the Repression of Narcotics Trafficking (OCRTIS) [9, 10]. In 2007, its name was changed to OSIRIS (Information System and Tool for Drug-Related Offences). NEMO study Six """"three-sample capture/recapture analyses"""" were carried out in 2005-2006 in order to estimate the number of problem drug users in Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Metz, Rennes and Toulouse (NEMO study). In each participating town, the geographical area was defined taking account of the presence and coverage of the existing data sources and the administrative relevance of the geographical divisions.  The study areas were the following: the Urban Community of Lille Métropole with almost 1.1 million inhabitants, """"Greater Lyon"""" comprising 57 districts with almost 1.2 million inhabitants, inner Marseille with almost 800,000 inhabitants, the Metz area covering 61 districts with 310,000 inhabitants, the Rennes area comprising 10 districts with almost 270,000 inhabitants and the Toulouse metropolitan area with 72 districts and 760,000 inhabitants. Data sources for problem drug users were identified and the data were collected from these sources over a six-month period between 2005 and 2006. These sources notably included the drug treatment centres, general practitioners, hospital units (infectious diseases, accident and emergency departments), low-threshold reception facilities (CAARUD), social services and law enforcement sources such as drug squads, the justice system, treatment units in prison and data held by the Central Office for the Repression of Narcotics Trafficking (OCRTIS).  Data collection in prison was delayed for two months, compared to other data sources, in order to allow problem drug users entering prison during the last two months of the survey to be """"captured"""" by other data sources.  For each study (each town), the different data sources were grouped into three samples using a statistical criteria (an odds ratio between two data sources greater than one, suggesting possible linkage between both sources, leading to both data sources being combined) and a field criterion (when two data sources are locally known to be related). The final samples obtained were: •In Lille, 1,815 records corresponding to 1,683 problem drug users, 7.5 % of whom were present in several samples. • In Lyon, 1,363 records corresponding to 1,267 people, 7.3 % of whom were present in more than one sample. •In Marseille, 929 records corresponding to 799 identified individuals, with only 4.2 % in several samples. •In Metz, 467 individuals were identified from 502 records, 6.8 % of whom were present in several samples. •In Rennes, 409 records corresponding to 351 people, 15.4 % of whom were present in several samples. •In Toulouse, 1,151 records corresponding to 1,090 people, 5.5 % of whom were present in several samples. Subjects were included in the study if they had resided for more than three months in one of the six cities, if they declared having used at least one illegal drug over the last 30 days (cannabis excluded): opiates, cocaine/crack, other stimulants and/or hallucinogens, and if they were 15-64 years old.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

For PM estimate: The (N = B / c) method is based on the ability to estimate two values: B: Number of drug users arrested by the police in a given year c: probability, for a drug user, of being arrested by the police in a given year. In 2005-2006 , there were 15,118 arrests for drug law offences involving heroin or cocaine use.  These arrests represent an approximation for the number B. The people concerned are not all """"problem drug users"""" as defined in the European protocol (see above), as an occasional user can be arrested by the police.  Nevertheless, it is very likely that people arrested by the police will meet the criteria enabling them to be included in the target group. In addition, the statistics record numbers of arrests and not numbers of people arrested.  A study published by the OFDT in 1998 examined this difference and found, amongst other things, that the average number of arrests per person for heroin was 1.38 [16]. More recently, OCRTIS compared these arrest statistics to the number of people involved. In 2005, there were 4,486 arrests for heroin use while 4,177 people were arrested for heroin use, i.e. a ratio of 1.07.  The equivalent ratio for cocaine was 1.02 [9]. The number of arrests can therefore be taken as a good approximation of the number of people arrested for heroin or cocaine use. Finally, to estimate """"c"""", the arrest statistics for the departments concerned can be compared to the estimates of the number of problem drug users from the NEMO studies.  This produces the average number of arrests for a problem drug user. Using the available data, the intermediary variables in the equation become: •B: Number of arrests for heroin or cocaine use in a given year •c: average number of arrests for heroin or cocaine use in a problem drug user for a given year. All of the procedures arising from narcotics offences conducted by the police and the gendarmerie in France (including the overseas departments, DOM) are recorded in the National file of narcotics legislation offences (FNAILS), except for offences identified by customs officials which did not result in a report.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
(3) 10c: Target population:All in-patients of treatment centres recorded in 2013 and 2014 following the TDI protocol. Method: Capture-recapture using a single list over a 2-year period. HRDU/PDU were located in both register and the 2013 and 2014 databases were merged to estimate the number of patients recorded once only and those recorded twice.

(12) 16c: The method referred to is based upon the exhaustive annual census of patients in Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST) at the national level provided by the national OST register and the annual OST in-treatment rate provided by the national drug monitoring system RELIS: (ROSTRELIS). Since patients undergoing OST are exclusively opioid users (OU) and exhaustively registered by the national OST register, the application of the OST multiplier, provided annually by the national RELIS system, allows estimating the number of OU. The RELIS monitoring systems is based on data collection from problem drug users in contact with national institutions (DR and SR) and provides data on drug use pattern of HRDU at the national level. Preferential drug use, including opiates’ use, is routine items of the RELIS data protocol, which allows to calculate the proportion of HRDU showing opioid use (ROU). Thus, the estimated number of OUs determined by the previous estimation steps can be used to estimate the number of PDU/HRDU. OST clients are fully included;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For 2000:Two-sample capture-recapture between police and substitution treatment sample, potential interactions cannot be accounted for. Possibly an overestimation due to systematic bias in the registries.policesubstitution treatment. For 2001 to 2004: Substitution treatment clients, opiate related police charges.The CRC estimates for the years 2001 to 2004 were carried out in the framework of the ""Monitoring Project"". Also 3 sample CRC using drug related death were calculated but lead to unstable result (due to the low number of DRD). So it was decided to only use 2 sample CRC. With this method possible interactions between the two sources used cannot be controlled. The results have to be interpreted very cautious. The substitution treatment database is based on the notification of the begin and the end of treatments. If the notification of the end is missing the client stays as ""ghost case"" in the database which would cause a cumulative error in the estimations (overestimation) over the years. Since there was no information about the proportion of this error there was no possibility to correct it in earlier estimations transmitted to the EMCDDA. In the new estimations for the years 2002 to 2004 delivered this year the bias was statistically corrected by weighting the substitution cases by their probability of beeing a ghost case based on the respective substitution length. The weight used was gained by a special project in 2004 (investigation of 600 randomly selected clients concerning their treatment status). Please replace the former transmitted estimations for 2001 and 2002 with this new estimations. For 2005-2007:The CRC estimates for the years 2005 to 2007 were carried out in the framework of the ""Monitoring Project"". Also 3 sample CRC using drug related death were calculated but lead to unstable result (due to the low number of DRD). So it was decided to only use 2 sample CRC. With this method possible interactions between the two sources used cannot be controlled. The results have to be interpreted very cautious. The substitution treatment database is based on the notification of the begin and the end of treatments. If the notification of the end is missing the client stays as ""ghost case"" in the database which would cause a cumulative error in the estimations (overestimation) over the years. The bias was statistically corrected by weighting the substitution cases by their probability of beeing a ghost case based on the respective substitution length. The weight used was gained by a special project in 2004 (investigation of 600 randomly selected clients concerning their treatment status). In 2007 some corrections concerning ghost cases were done in the database. Due to this fact the correction factor calculated in 2004 is not correct anymore and probably leads to an underestimation of the prevalence. A comparison of the unweighted estimates for 2004 before and after the correction (using an old version of the database) lead to the conclusion that the corrections in the database do not influence the estimates very much. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;
"(21) 20a2: Nevertheless the estimation without correction factor for 2005 would be: 44450 [41781:47119]. In our drug report we use the lower bound of the confidence interval of the estimation with correction factor and the upper bound form the estimation without the correction factor which leads to an estimation 28491 to 47119. (for 2006 would be: 37114 [35157:39071]. In our drug report we use the lower bound of the confidence interval of the estimation with correction factor and the upper bound form the estimation without the correction factor which leads to an estimation 23908 to 39071 and for 2007:32069 [30678:33461]. In our drug report we use the lower bound of the confidence interval of the estimation with correction factor and the upper bound form the estimation without the correction factor which leads to an estimation 22198 to 33461. ) Concerning trends both estimations (with correction factor and without correction factor) lead to the same results: - there is an increase of prevalence until 2004 and since then the prevalence rates decrease to some extent. For the future the situation will improve a lot due to the fact that there will be a new data collection system on substitution treatment which will avoid the ghost case problem. substitution register (substitution treatment clients). drug related police notifications (person with opiate related police notification). For 2008:Substitution register (not only methadone).The main problem with this source of data is that when the end of a treatment is not reported the person stays as ""ghost case"" in the register. In 2004 a correction factor was calculated based on a validation study. This factor is used below.drug related police notifications.The main problem with this source of data is that the proportion of persons notified who just deal and do not consume opiates is not known.persons with opiate related police notifications. For 2009-2011: In the framework of eSuchtmittel this problem could be solved. For 2009 the correction factor is not used anymore.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
(22) 21a: Benchmark method with use of nominations from general population survey and treatment data. The central estimate is a simple mean from Low and High prevalence estimates For 2002 estimate: within the framework of a countrywide population survey of 2002. Three estimations were conducted on the basis of the following registers: residential drug treatment, out-patient and HIV cases.For 2005,2009,2014: Respondents were ask about known to them drug addicts, that means regular drug users experiencing serious drug related problems. Each nominees was reported individually (gender, age group, opiate use, injection use, residential treatment and out-patient treatment utilization/ambulatory data ). Based on proportion of treated among nominees with known treatment status the multiplier was calculated. It was done twice for residential treatment and out-patient treatment separately. Two estimation achieved this way were used to create range.For 2005: Residential treatment statistics, Person treated in residential treatment facility due to drug problem (ICD-10, codes F11-F16, F18, F19).

(26) 22d: CR method with treatment data and criminal justice data as sources. Drug treatment source includes all clients of public and licenced inpatient settings (therapeutic community, detoxification unit) and all clients that started or were readmited at treatment in public outpatient settings in mainland Portugal. The overall availability and acessibility of these structures is very high in Portugal (mainland). Also, the registration practices of the designated clients are the norm. All the information is gathered, revised and analised at SICAD.Case definition for this source was clients that used cocaine (incçuding powder and crack cocaine) or f opioids (including heroin, methadone misused, buprenorphine misused and other opioids) and /or amphetamines/ methamphetamines in the last 12 months. In contrast with current definitions of HRDU, this definition doesn't include the criteria of frequency of drug use (weekly or more)in the last 6 months or more. Criminal Justice source includes all individuals identified by the police or courts as drugs users (in the possession of a quantity of an illicit drug equal or inferior to the total amount considered for an average individual consumption through 10 days, or, in some cases, superior, but after an assessment by the court, determined as for an individual consumption and not for traffiking). All these individuals have to go to a Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction, where all are registered in this information system (mainland Portugal). Case definition for this source is:Individuals found in the possession of cocaine or opioids or amphetamines/methampetamines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(27) 22e: Capture-recapture with 3 national data sources, 2 from Treatment (one from inpatient services and other from outpatient services) and other from Justice. The data source of inpatient care results from the merging of 4 distinct national data sources: Private/Public Detoxification Units and Private/Public Therapeutic Communities. Data Source A includes all clients of public and licenced inpatient settings (therapeutic community, detoxification unit) in mainland Portugal. The overall availability and acessibility of these structures is very high in mainland Portugal. Also, the registration practices of the designated clients are the norm. All the information is gathered, revised and analised at SICAD.Data Source B includes all clients that started or were readmited at treatment in public outpatient settings in mainland Portugal. The overall availability and acessibility of these structures is very high in mainland Portugal. Also, the registration practices of the designated clients are the norm. All the information is gathered, revised and analised at SICAD. Data Source C refers to the justice system but not at a criminal level. Includes all individuals identified by the police or courts as drugs users (in the possession of a quantity of an illicit drug equal or inferior to the total amount considered for an average individual consumption through 10 days, or, in some cases, superior, but after an assessment by the court, determined as for an individual consumption and not for traffiking). All these individuals have to go to a Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction, where all are registered in this information system (mainland Portugal).Target population:Users of cocaine (including poder cocaine and crack cocaine) or opioids (including heroin, methadone misused, buprenorphine misused and other opioids) and/or amphetamines/methamphetamines in the last 12 months. In contrast with current definitions of HRDU, this definition doesn't include the criteria of frequency of drug use (weekly or more)in the last 6 months or more. Those OST clients which continue high risk drug use behaviours are included due to occurence at data sources. This estimation is based on the capture-recapture method, using the Generalised Linear Models to determine the unknown population from the intersections between 3 data sources. The method is different from the previous estimations (2000, 2005, 2012) and, for this reason, it is not feasible to compare estimations between years. This estimation has some limitations:1) For a confidence interval of 95%, the range between the lower and the higher number or rate/1000 is very wide. 2) Two of the three data sources used are both from Treatment, although from different systems (inpatient/outpatient)3) The treatment/outpatient data source has only the clients that started treatment in the year (new and readmitted), in order to provide more recent data 4) The justice data source has information on possession , not on consumption 5) Concerning the common definition case between data sources, the estimation is on recent use, however the definition doesn't include the criteria of frequency of drug use ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Number of persons per 100 000 inhabitants of each region, who addmitted the use of heroin, amphetamines or cocaine in the last year (general population survey). Anchor points were used from a two-source capture-recapture estimate computed in two regions. Remark 1: used data from the 2001 population census, used definition is: females 15-54 and males 15-59, which is based on the 2001 Slovak definition of productive age. Remark 2: Possible biases: all drugs were pooled in one estimate, there were only 2 anchor points and they were based on only two-source capture-recapture, moreover the overlap was sought between health-care sector based drug treatment and drug treatment in prisons, which could lead to overestimate (through lowering the probability of appearing in both data sources due to incarceration). In case of unavailability or lower accessibility of drugs, these can be also replaced by alcohol use and this can vary among the regions, which can also lead to bias in the drug use factor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(30) 25b: Multiplier method - using data of low treshold agencies. Number of clients in contact with low treshold agencies (benchmark).Proportion of drug users in contact with low threshold agencies (ITR). Questionnaire survey in 2005 (nomination technique) among 223 respondents - clients of low threshold services was carried out. The national estimate has been calculated as follows: local estimates for Bratislava + estimates for the rest of Slovak Republic. The estimate for Bratislava has been obtained directly from multiplier method with data for Bratislava. For the calculation of PDU for the rest of Slovakia, the average rate per 1000 inhabitants from multiplier method studies in remaining 7 cities has been used;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(32) 26b: High risk drug user is defined as someone who has had contact with the police or the health care services regarding amphetamines or opioids use or has recently got HVC due injecting drugs. As amphetamines and opioids are the most common drugs used by injecting in Finland, we can also estimate that this overall HRDU estimate is also an estimate for injecting drug use.3 sources Capture-recapture method in Bayesian framework. Assumption:  individuals in the particular population have homogenous catch-up probabilities or robust to mean small departures. Model averaging is applied to create a supermodel.

"(33) 26c: Capture-recapture method in Bayesian framework, median values are reported. Assumption:  individuals in the particular population have homogenous catch-up probabilities or robust to mean small departures. Also, it is assumed that registry dependencies can be explained well enough by using the identifiable interactions in the models. Model averaging is applied to create a supermodel. A supermodel should be at least as good as the best component model; this means that a supermodel is as good as the saturated model.  Model averaging also automatically gives more weight to component models of good fit. By calculating model averaged estimates, sensitivity to the particular chosen model was """"removed"""" (which interactions were to be included in the model etc.). This model uncertainty, when taken into account, widens the credible intervals. Expected total population sizes were estimated using a Poisson log-linear model with model averaging using Gibbs variable selection method. Stratifications were used to take into account potential heterogeneities in capture probabilities. The most import factor seemed to be the age. The candidate models had a priori the same probability. Almost all priors for model parameters were weakly informative, in some cases (small populations etc), more informative priors were used using information from previous estimates in that particular subpopulation. It seems that health care registries are more probably positively correlated and health care registries and the police registry negatively correlated. Sufficien number of iterations were calculated to ensure convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC), Rubin-Gelman criterion. We used Jags-sampler with R-3.1.4 to simulate posterior distributions. 4 sources: 3-way interactions (or less) of sources were allowed.  The more informative prior was often needed in estimating the (small) subpopulation sizes. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;

National estimate is a sum of both of them.Estimated number of PDUs - opiates (heroin + Subutex (buprenorphine)(+ other opioids for 2015)) users and/or pervitin (methamphetamine) users in the Czech Republic unless Prague (done by multiplier method with the data on clients in contact with low threshold facilities/programmes).Estimated number of PDUs - opiates (heroin + Subutex (buprenorphine)(+ other opioids for 2015)) users and/or pervitin (methamphetamine) users in Prague (done by multiplier method with the data on clients in contact with low threshold facilities/programmes).  For 2004,2005 estimates:Reports from low-threshold facilities - number of pervitin (methamphetamine) and opiate users in contact with these facilities in 2004/2005.HCV national study - in-treatment rate (portion of above mentioned persons in contact with low-threshold facilities, nomination technique used). For 2002: benchmark - number of pervitin (methamphetamine) and opiate users in contact with low-threshold facilities in 2002.Low-threshold facilities. For 2000: Treatment Demand register.Multiplier method, using as benchmark the Treatment Demand register and for the in-treatment rate capture-recapture and nomination techniques at the local level.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Capture-recapture method with two registers;Sources: A) The National Patient Register (patients admitted to treatment at the hospital with the ICD-10 code:F11.1, F11.2, F11.9, F12.1, F12.2, F12.9, F14.1, F14.2, F14.9, F15.1, F15.2, F15.9, F19.1, F19.2,F19.9). B) National Register of Drug Abusers undergoing treatment (clients admitted to treatment for their drug problems, including persistant use of cannabis).Estimate for 2001 is estimated to contain 6000 problem users of cannabis only.The estimate for 1996 is not directly comparable with the estimates for 1998 and 2001. For 1996 the National Register of Drug Abusers undergoing Treatment is not as complete as it is for the following years.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

(54) 5d: National extrapolation from treatment data stemming from two different sources (i.e. the German Statistical Report on Treatment Centres for Substance Use Disorders [Deutsche Suchthilfestatistik, DSHS] and the Statistical Report on Hospital Diagnoses [Krankenhausdiagnosestatistik des Statistischen Bundesamtes]). In particular, the overall figure of treated cases is calculated on the basis of recorded client figures in outpatient and inpatient treatment, the total figure of counselling facilities as well as a multiplier (due to the lack of full coverage) for reaching the target group. The multiplier derives from respective publications providing estimates of problematic use of illicit substances and help-seeking behaviour in the general population and comparisons to the availability of substance use health care in the same area. Moreover, the minimum and maximum estimate corresponds to the calculation when estimating a 20% or a 5% double counting rate, respectively. Compared to previous years, an additional source of information was used for acquiring an updated total number of cases in treatment due to substance (i.e. opiates, cocaine and stimulants) related problems: until 2010, the part on inpatient treatment was only based on the diagnostic data of the patients in hospitals (Statistical Report on Hospital Diagnoses), whereas since 2012 (2011 data), the DSHS was added to refine the estimation based on inpatient treatment cases. In addition to this, since 2011 (2010 data), a new source of information was used for acquiring an updated total number of the existing outpatient facilities, which is required as a reference number to estimate the coverage. Specifically, from 2005 onwards -due to the lack of most recent reliable data- an unchanged number referring to the total number of facilities was being used deriving from a study in 2004 (N=934). It can be assumed that this was leading to an underestimation of the estimate in the treatment setting since the expansion of the care system was not being taken into account. Since 2008 the Central Register of In- and Out-patient Treatment Facilities for Substance Use Disorders serves as a source for providing the total number of outpatient facilities. The structure of this Register is adjusted to the definitions used in the core data system of the DSHS.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"(55) 7a: Combined interval from multiple capture-recapture and truncated Poisson.6308: estimate for problematic opiate users with medical problems; 13735: estimate for opiate users with both medical and social/legal problems; The higher figure only is compatible with the EMCDDA definition of problem drug use and is used for country comparisons.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

"(57) 10a1: Six variables were initially considered for each mainland department, expressed as levels per 100,000 inhabitants between 15 and 64 years old: the number of people receiving treatment; the number of low-threshold centre users;  Stéribox ® (sterile syringe kit) sales figures; methadone sales figures; high dose buprenorphine (HDB) sales figures; and drug law offences (ILS).  Five other socio-demographic indicators were subsequently considered: unemployment rate; medium income; enrolment percentage for 17 to 25-year-olds in a higher education establishment; population receiving social assistance or specific grants; population with French universal Social Security cover (CMU).Firstly, a correlation matrix was produced for the variables concerned in order to identify statistically significant relationships.  Secondly, the variables used were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA), with the aim of weighting each individual statistic (in this case the 96 mainland départements) in order to estimate the user population. For 2011:MIM based on 6 anchor points - firstly extrapolated to the """"départements"""" and secondly extended to all 96 """"départements"""" of metropolitan France. Police and treatment centres, number of Steribox and average OST doses were calculated using data provided by the Social security. For TM estimate:The (N = B / c) method is based on the ability to estimate two values: B: Number of drug users undergoing treatment in a given year; c: the probability, for a drug user, of being treated during the year. These values are not directly available in France although they may be estimated from substitution treatment data, which are widely accessible for drug users.  Based on HDB and methadone sales data in 2006, and using the currently accepted hypotheses on average daily doses prescribed for these two drugs (8 mg for HDB and 60 mg for methadone), the number of drug users receiving substitution treatment in mainland France can be estimated at 85,000. These data are also available on a departmental scale.  They can therefore be compared to the estimates of the number of problem drug users from the NEMO studies in order to estimate the probability of a problem drug user receiving this type of treatment.  NEMO study Six """"three-sample capture/recapture analyses"""" were carried out in 2005-2006 in order to estimate the number of problem drug users in Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Metz, Rennes and Toulouse (NEMO study). In each participating town, the geographical area was defined taking account of the presence and coverage of the existing data sources and the administrative relevance of the geographical divisions.  The study areas were the following: the Urban Community of Lille Métropole with almost 1.1 million inhabitants, """"Greater Lyon"""" comprising 57 districts with almost 1.2 million inhabitants, inner Marseille with almost 800,000 inhabitants, the Metz area covering 61 districts with 310,000 inhabitants, the Rennes area comprising 10 districts with almost 270,000 inhabitants and the Toulouse metropolitan area with 72 districts and 760,000 inhabitants. Data sources for problem drug users were identified and the data were collected from these sources over a six-month period between 2005 and 2006. These sources notably included the drug treatment centres, general practitioners, hospital units (infectious diseases, accident and emergency departments), low-threshold reception facilities (CAARUD), social services and law enforcement sources such as drug squads, the justice system, treatment units in prison and data held by the Central Office for the Repression of Narcotics Trafficking (OCRTIS).";;;;;;;;;;;;;
