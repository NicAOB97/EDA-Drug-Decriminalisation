(1) In surveys with small sample sizes results should be interpreted with caution.;;;;;;
(2) Countries were asked to report results using, as far as possible, EMCDDA standard age groups (all adults: 15-64, young adults: 15-34). In countries where age ranges are more restrictive, prevalence estimates may tend to be slightly higher. Some countries have recalculated their prevalence figures using the EMCDDA standard age groups.;;;;;;
(3) Data referring to years preceding 2008 are not presented.;;;;;;
(4) This table presents the results for the last surveys available in each country. It aims to present an overview of national surveys. Some city surveys reported by countries were not included as they tend to produce higher prevalence estimates which are not comparable with estimates for whole countries (or large regions with both urban and rural areas).;;;;;;
"(5) ""Sample size"" refers to the number of actual respondents to the survey (Net sample). In some cases, national surveys cover originally a broader age range (""original age range"") than that presented here for the standard groups ""All adults""(15-64) and ""Young adults"" (15-34). Sample sizes are presented respectively for the ""All adults"" (15-64), ""Young adults"" groups (15-34) and ""younger adults"" (15-24).";;;;;;
(6) United Kingdom: Data for the United Kingdom is for England and Wales only. The UK data has not been validated with the UK authorities since leaving the EU at the end of the transition period.;;;;;;
